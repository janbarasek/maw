How to install
--------------

These scripts have been tested on Debian Lenny. You need maxima,
maxima-shared, gnuplot, convert, formconv, gettext (including perl
support, mercurial) and working TeX installation (including LaTeX and
pdfLaTeX). If you have these tools on your computer, installation of
MAW is pretty simple: it is sufficient to copy files into required
directories and set few environment variables in php files.

The installation has been tested on Debian Lenny.

The installation script downloads the files, compiles language files,
creates log directories and sets permisions for these directories.

1. Put timeout script from support dierctory somewhere into the PATH 
   of the www user (/usr/bin).

2. You may want to put maw-html files into suitable directory. 
   Customize maw-html/mawconfightml.php.

3. Put the directory maw to /var/www of your server. If you use another
   path, you must set the global variables defined in maw/common/maw.php
   directory. The best place where to [put these customizations is the
   maw/commmon/mawconfig.php file. Check that www user has write access to
   files in /var/www/maw/common/log.

4. For some calculators you must install formconv package
   http://formconv.sourceforge.net/ (compiled binaries are part of
   WMI2 bin distribution, http://sourceforge.net/projects/wmi),
   jsmath (put the directory jsMath to /var/www) and mathtex.
   
5. You may want customize 

   * variable $server defined in in maw-html/index.php (this
     should point to the server with maw directory php files, since
     I have html part on another server than the computing part).

   * variables $pdflatex, $latex, $dvips, .... and  $texrender in the 
     file maw/common/maw.php

6. You can test the installation by opening the file maw/common/test.php.
   If you encounter any problem with installation, send a message to 
   the authors.
